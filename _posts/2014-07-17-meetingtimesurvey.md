## Today's Meeting Recap

Jessica and Brandon will work on presentation for tomorrow. Everyone will help out.
It is decided that we will take in those 2 giant robotic arms.
Meet at the club room at no later than 13:30 sharp. Or will be left behind for Aerotech Field Trip.

The TelePresenter Robot project will put into backlog. Focus on small line following robot and automation system first.

Any objection, please report to @Charles the Tyrant.
