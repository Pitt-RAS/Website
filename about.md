Though the official name is "Robotics and Automation Society at University of Pittsburgh", we are too lay and just call
ourselves the "robotics club". No objection allowed.

## We are all about:

* Having fun with robots
* Making cool and awesome robots and learn from both success and failure
* Get together and talk about tech while enjoy a food
* Teach new members how awesome life is
