##Brandon Contino

I am a sophomore pursuing an Electrical Engineering degree at the Sawnson School of Engineering. Relatively new to 
the world of robotics and I am primarily interested in aerial robots, but finds all robots intriguing.
 
When I am younger, I used to dress up as a Broncos player and sing the Brocons fight song (I am originally from Colorado)
