##Brandon Contino


Hello! I am a sophomore pursuing an Electrical Engineering degree
at the Swanson School of Engineering. As a disclaimer, I am relatively new
to the world of robotics, and therefore do not have a vast knowledge about
them; however, I do find all robots intriguing, especially aerial ones.
Just as a little thing to keep between us, when I was younger I used to
dress up as a Broncos player and sing the Broncos fight song (I am
originally from Colorado).

Codename "The Dullahan"
