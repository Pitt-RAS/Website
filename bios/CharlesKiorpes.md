##Charles Kiorpes

Charles is a senior Computer Science major with a passion for embedded, systems, and bare-metal programming.
He has previously worked on research and technical projects involving autonomous quadcopters, and is also an avid tinkerer and DIYer.

On a clear and not-too-windy day, you might find Charles out in a field letting one of his robots fly.
